Rick roll people using this website. It will redirect all users.

## Usage
Go to [Bitly](https://bitly.com) or any other link shorteners and shorten `https://ventispurr.github.io`.

Most link shorteners like [Bitly](https://bitly.com) will display the target website when sent on platforms like Discord.
